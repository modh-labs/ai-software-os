# Modh Fundamentals

> My system for growing and scaling engineering teams through operational discipline.

**— Ibrahim Gardezi**

## What This Is

This is **my playbook** for scaling software companies. Not theory from a book. Battle-tested systems I've used to:

- Scale Aura (AI-powered sales platform) from 0 to production
- Manage distributed engineering teams shipping daily
- Install operational discipline at SaaS companies
- Turn slow-moving teams into high-velocity shipping machines

**These systems work.** I've used them over and over. Now I'm sharing them.

---

## The Problem I Solve

I join software companies and see the same dysfunctions everywhere:

- **Projects take months** (scope creeps weekly, teams lose momentum)
- **Teams debate everything** (3-day Slack threads about CSS class names)
- **Backlogs are graveyards** (500+ tickets, half from 2 years ago)
- **Culture is vague** ("We value innovation" - what does that even mean?)

**The result:** Slow shipping. Analysis paralysis. Good engineers stuck in bad systems.

---

## My Systems (The Modh Fundamentals)

### 1. Project Scoping

**What I Do:**

Scope every project to 1–3 weeks max. Use 3 complexity tiers to guide breakdown:

- **Quick Win (0–2 days):** Single file, clear scope → Ship as-is
- **Standard (3–5 days):** Multi-component, tests → Single ticket
- **Complex (6+ days):** Needs breakdown → 2–3 milestones

**Outcome:** 90% of projects ship in \<3 weeks. Scope creep drops 70%. Team velocity 3x.

**Read:** `project-scoping.md`

---

### 2. Decision Velocity

**What I Do:**

Teach teams the Two-Way Door framework (stolen from Amazon):

- **Two-way doors** (reversible): Component structure, styling, copy → Ship immediately
- **One-way doors** (hard to reverse): Schema changes, API contracts → Discuss 24–48 hours, then decide

**Outcome:** 90% of decisions made same-day. Engineers ship 5x more (stop waiting for approval).

**Read:** `decision-velocity.md`

---

### 3. Engineering Values

**What I Do:**

Install 6 concrete values that translate to daily behavior:

1. **Ship Over Plan** - Deploy daily, scope to \<3 weeks
2. **Own the Outcome** - You monitor prod, you fix bugs
3. **AI-Native** - Use every force multiplier available
4. **Build for Creators** - Purpose-built workflows beat infinite flexibility
5. **Finish Everything** - No 90% solutions
6. **Direct Communication** - Say what you mean

**Outcome:** Shared language, clear expectations, culture that ships.

**Read:** `engineering-values.md`

---

### 4. Backlog Hygiene

**What I Do:**

Clean 500-ticket backlogs in 1–2 weeks:

- **Week 1:** Close zombies (>3 months old), duplicates, vague tickets → 500 → 50 tickets
- **Week 2:** Install automation (auto-close, triage, complexity labels)

**Outcome:** Backlog stays \<50 tickets. Teams know what's actually getting worked on.

**Read:** `backlog-hygiene.md`

---

## How I Install These at Your Company

**Typical engagement: 4–8 weeks**

### Week 1: Audit

- Where are teams stuck? (slow shipping, analysis paralysis, backlog chaos)
- Which system fixes the biggest pain point?

### Weeks 2–4: Install

- Project scoping (if projects take months)
- Decision velocity (if teams debate everything)
- Backlog hygiene (if backlog has 200+ tickets)
- Engineering values (if culture is vague)

### Weeks 5–8: Validate

- Measure impact (velocity, decision time, backlog health)
- Train team to own it going forward
- Hand off (you don't need me long-term)

**Outcome:** Team operating from a shared playbook. Faster decisions, better quality, clearer culture.

## How to Use This Repo

### If You're Scaling Your Own Company

1. **Read the systems** (start with project-scoping.md)
2. **Pick the biggest pain point** (slow shipping? analysis paralysis? backlog chaos?)
3. **Install one system** (don't try all 4 at once)
4. **Measure before/after** (velocity, decision time, backlog health)
5. **Iterate** (adapt to your context)

### If You're Building Your Personal Brand

These systems are **perfect for content**:

- LinkedIn posts (carousels showing complexity tiers)
- Instagram content (one system per post)
- Reels/TikTok (decision velocity in 60 seconds)
- Newsletter (deep dives on each system)

**See:** `content-strategy.md` for specific post ideas and positioning.

### If You're a Consultant/Advisor

Use these systems to **diagnose and fix organizational dysfunction**:

- Slow shipping? → Install project scoping
- Analysis paralysis? → Install decision velocity
- Backlog chaos? → Install backlog hygiene
- Vague culture? → Install engineering values

**Measure before/after** to prove ROI.

## What Makes This Different

**vs Agile/Scrum:**
- No sprints, no story points, no ceremonies
- Continuous flow with 1–3 week chunks
- Shipping over process compliance

**vs Shape Up:**
- Lighter weight (no betting table, no formal cycles)
- Works for small teams (2–10 people)
- Emphasis on autonomy over coordination

**vs Linear Method:**
- Not tied to a specific tool (portable)
- Includes engineering values + decision frameworks
- Adapted for AI-native teams (Claude Code, Cursor)

**My approach:** Take the best ideas from proven methodologies. Strip out the bureaucracy. Make it work for real teams.

## Real Results

**Before my systems:**
- Projects take 3+ months
- 3-day Slack threads debating trivial decisions
- 500-ticket backlogs (nobody knows what's real)
- Vague culture ("We value innovation")

**After my systems:**
- 90% of projects ship in \<3 weeks
- 90% of decisions made same-day
- \<50 ticket backlogs (clean, actionable)
- Clear values that translate to daily behavior

**The unlock:** Operational systems that make shipping easy, not heroic.

## This Is My Core IP

I bring these systems to every software company I work with.

**What you get:**
- Faster shipping (1–3 week cycles, not 3+ months)
- Faster decisions (hours, not days)
- Clean backlogs (reflects reality)
- Culture that ships (not just talks)

**When you need me:** If you're scaling past 10 engineers and things are starting to break down.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Read one system** (pick your biggest pain point)
2. **Try it at your company** (start small, one team)
3. **Measure the impact** (velocity, decision time, backlog health)
4. **DM me** if you want help installing this at scale

This is how I grow and scale your engineering team.
