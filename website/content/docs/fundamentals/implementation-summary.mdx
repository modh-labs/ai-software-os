### Option 2: Use for Consulting/Advisory

**When you talk to a potential client:**

**Step 1: Diagnose**
- "How long do your projects take?" → Project Scoping
- "How fast do decisions get made?" → Decision Velocity
- "How many tickets in your backlog?" → Backlog Hygiene

**Step 2: Position**
- "I have a system for exactly this problem. I installed it at Aura and multiple SaaS companies."
- "Takes 4–8 weeks. Here's what changes..."

**Step 3: Send the docs**
- Email them the relevant markdown file
- "Here's my playbook for [System]. This is what I'd install at your company."

**Step 4: Close**
- Typical engagement: 4–8 weeks
- Outcome: 90% projects \<3 weeks, velocity 3x, clean backlogs

### Option 3: Build a Lead Magnet

**Turn one system into a PDF:**

1. Take `fundamentals/backlog-hygiene.md`
2. Design as PDF (Canva, Figma, or hire designer)
3. Title: "The Backlog Cleanup Playbook: 500 Tickets → 50 in 1 Week"
4. Gate with email signup
5. LinkedIn/IG posts: "DM me 'backlog' for my cleanup playbook"

**You now have lead gen.**

## What Makes This Your IP

**vs Generic Frameworks:**
- Written in first-person (your voice)
- Battle-tested at Aura + real SaaS companies
- Includes real results (90% \<3 weeks, velocity 3x)
- Portable (works at any company)

## Origin Story (Use in Content)

"I built these systems while scaling Aura (AI-powered sales platform) from 0 to production.

I saw the same dysfunctions everywhere:
- Projects taking months
- Teams debating everything
- 500-ticket backlogs
- Vague culture

So I installed 4 systems that fixed it:
- Project Scoping (1–3 week chunks)
- Decision Velocity (two-way doors)
- Backlog Hygiene (ruthless pruning)
- Engineering Values (culture that ships)

Real results:
- 90% of projects \<3 weeks
- Team velocity 3x
- Clean backlogs

Now I bring these systems to every software company I work with.

This is how I grow and scale your engineering team."
