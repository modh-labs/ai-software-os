# Week 1 Content: Ready to Post

> Copy-paste content for your first week. No editing needed.

## Monday: LinkedIn Text Post

**Topic:** Project Scoping

**Copy this exactly:**

```
I see this problem everywhere:

Projects take 3+ months. Scope creeps weekly. Teams lose momentum.

Here's the system I use:

Every project scoped to 1–3 weeks max. I use 3 complexity tiers:
• Quick Win (0–2 days) → Ship as-is
• Standard (3–5 days) → Single ticket
• Complex (6+ days) → Break into milestones

If it's >3 weeks, it's too big. Break it down.

Real results:
• 90% of projects ship in <3 weeks
• Scope creep drops 70%
• Team velocity 3x

This system works because most teams confuse "big vision" with "big first version."

Ship small. Learn fast. Iterate.

DM me if your projects routinely take months.

## Wednesday: LinkedIn Carousel

**Title:** "How I Ship Projects in \<3 Weeks"

**8 Slides (text for each):**

### Slide 1 (Hook)
```
Your team ships too slow.

Here's why.
```

### Slide 2 (Problem)
```
Most projects take months.

Scope creeps weekly.

Teams lose momentum.
```

### Slide 3 (Framework)
```
I use 3 complexity tiers:

• Quick Win (0–2 days)
• Standard (3–5 days)
• Complex (6+ days)
```

### Slide 4 (Quick Win)
```
Quick Win (0–2 days)

Single file, clear scope
No database changes
Existing patterns

→ Ship as-is
```

### Slide 5 (Standard)
```
Standard (3–5 days)

Multi-component
Database + UI changes
Comprehensive tests

→ Single ticket
```

### Slide 6 (Complex)
```
Complex (6+ days)

Too big!

→ Break into 2–3 milestones
→ Each milestone <1 week
→ Each ships value independently
```

### Slide 7 (Results)
```
Real Results

90% of projects <3 weeks
Scope creep drops 70%
Team velocity 3x

Not theory.
Battle-tested at real SaaS companies.
```

### Slide 8 (CTA)
```

How I ship projects in <3 weeks (save this 👇)

Most teams confuse "big vision" with "big first version."

You don't need 3 months to ship value. You need better scoping.

## Friday: Instagram Reel

**Script (60 seconds):**

```
[0–10s]
"I join a software company. Here's what I see everywhere:"

[10–20s]
"Projects take months. Scope creeps weekly. Teams lose momentum."

[20–30s]
"The problem? No scoping discipline."

[30–45s]
"Here's my system: Every project <3 weeks.

Quick Win (0–2 days).
Standard (3–5 days).
Complex (6+ days → break it down)."

[45–55s]
"Real results: 90% of projects ship in <3 weeks. Team velocity 3x."

[55–60s]
"DM me if your projects routinely take months."
```

**Visual Directions:**
- [0–10s] You talking to camera
- [10–20s] Frustrated hand gesture (universal "this is broken")
- [20–30s] Point to screen (as if pointing at problem)
- [30–45s] Show 3 fingers for 3 tiers (visual anchor)
- [45–55s] Smile (positive outcome)
- [55–60s] Point to camera (direct CTA)

**Text Overlays:**
- [30–45s] "Quick Win: 0–2 days" / "Standard: 3–5 days" / "Complex: 6+ days"
- [45–55s] "90% \<3 weeks | Velocity 3x"

Why your team ships too slow (and how I fix it in 4–8 weeks)

I install 4 systems:
→ Project Scoping (1–3 week chunks)
→ Decision Velocity (two-way doors)
→ Backlog Hygiene (500 → 50 tickets)
→ Engineering Values (culture that ships)

DM me if you're scaling past 10 engineers and need help.

## Friday: LinkedIn Native Video (Same Reel)

**Upload the same 60s video to LinkedIn as native video.**

Your team ships too slow. Here's why (and how I fix it).

I see this at every software company I join:

Projects take 3+ months. Teams debate everything. Backlogs are graveyards.

Here's what I install:

→ Project scoping (1–3 week chunks)
→ Decision velocity (two-way doors)
→ Backlog hygiene (500 → 50 tickets)
→ Engineering values (culture that ships)

Typical engagement: 4–8 weeks.

Real results: 90% of projects <3 weeks. Team velocity 3x. Clean backlogs.

DM me if you're scaling past 10 engineers.
```

## Engagement Responses (Copy-Paste Replies)

**When someone comments "This is great":**
```
Thanks! Which part resonates most for you?

(Curious if it's the complexity tiers or the 1–3 week rule)
```

**When someone asks "How do you handle enterprise projects?":**
```
Great question.

Even enterprise projects can be broken into 1–3 week milestones.

The key: Separate enabler work (schema, APIs) from feature work (UI, workflows).

Ship enablers first, then unblock features.

Happy to dig into specifics — DM me if you want to discuss your context.
```

**When someone says "This won't work for us":**
```
What's your biggest challenge with scoping?

(I've installed this at companies from 5 to 50 engineers — always curious about edge cases)
```

**When someone DMs "scoping":**
```
Hey! Here's my project scoping playbook: [link to project-scoping.md or PDF]

Quick context — what's your current project timeline? (So I can tailor this to your situation)

Also, what's the biggest bottleneck you're seeing? (Scope creep, slow decisions, backlog chaos?)
```
