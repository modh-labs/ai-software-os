# Hooks Overview

The AI Software OS includes **1 hook** for deterministic pattern enforcement.

## Pattern Enforcer

The `pattern-enforcer.py` hook runs automatically and catches common pattern violations before they make it into the codebase.

Location: `.claude/hooks/pattern-enforcer.py`

### What It Enforces

- Repository pattern usage (no direct `supabase.from()` calls)
- Server action conventions
- Import restrictions (no cross-route imports)
- Type safety (no `any` types)

### How It Works

The hook is a Python script that scans changed files and reports violations. It runs as a pre-commit check and integrates with Claude Code's hook system.
