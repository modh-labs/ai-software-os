## How Skills Work

Skills are stored in `.claude/skills/` and each contains a `SKILL.md` file with:
- **Frontmatter**: name, description, allowed tools
- **Activation rules**: When the skill automatically engages
- **Patterns**: The conventions and rules it enforces
- **References**: Example code and templates
