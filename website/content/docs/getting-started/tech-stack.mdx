# Supported Tech Stack

> This system was built for a specific stack but most patterns are adaptable. Here's what's assumed and how to swap alternatives.

## Core Stack (Tested With)

| Category | Tool | Role | Alternatives |
|----------|------|------|-------------|
| **Framework** | Next.js (App Router) | Full-stack web, SSR, API routes | Remix, SvelteKit, Nuxt |
| **Language** | TypeScript (strict) | Type safety everywhere | — |
| **UI Library** | React 19 | Components, hooks, Server Components | — (tied to Next.js) |
| **UI Components** | shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS | Design system, accessible primitives | Radix UI, Headless UI |
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Data, auth policies (RLS), real-time | Prisma + Postgres, Drizzle, PlanetScale |
| **Auth** | Clerk | Multi-tenant orgs, JWT, webhooks | Auth.js, Supabase Auth, Lucia |
| **Payments** | Stripe | Subscriptions, webhooks, seat billing | Paddle, Lemon Squeezy |
| **Testing** | Vitest + Playwright | Unit/integration + E2E | Jest, Cypress |
| **Observability** | Sentry + OpenTelemetry | Error tracking, tracing, performance | Datadog, New Relic, Axiom |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Quality gates, automated checks | GitLab CI, CircleCI |
| **AI Dev** | Claude Code + Cursor | Skills, agents, commands, hooks | — (this IS the system) |
| **Package Manager** | bun + Turborepo | Fast installs, monorepo orchestration | pnpm + Nx, npm workspaces |
| **Linting** | Biome | Lint + format in one tool | ESLint + Prettier |
| **Project Mgmt** | Linear | Issue tracking, backlog management | Jira, GitHub Issues |

## What's Portable vs Stack-Specific

### Fully Portable (works with any stack)
- All slash commands (`/audit`, `/review`, `/pr`, `/test`, `/new-feature`, `/create-migration`)
- Subagents (code-reviewer, test-runner, pr-creator, database-expert)
- Hook architecture (pattern-enforcer concept)
- All guides in `guides/security/`
- CI pipeline patterns
- Documentation conventions

### Needs Light Adaptation
- Repository pattern (swap Supabase client for Prisma/Drizzle)
- Server action patterns (swap for tRPC procedures or API routes)
- Component creation (swap shadcn for your component library)
- Testing patterns (swap Vitest API for Jest if needed)

### Supabase-Specific
- RLS policy patterns
- Schema-first migration workflow
- `select(*)` convention
- Organization isolation via JWT claims

### Next.js-Specific
- App Router file conventions
- Server Components / Client Components split
- `revalidatePath()` cache invalidation
- Route colocation patterns

## Adapting for Alternative Stacks

### If you use Prisma instead of Supabase
1. In `repository-pattern` skill: replace `SupabaseClient` with `PrismaClient`
2. Remove `select(*)` rule (Prisma uses type-safe select)
3. Replace RLS patterns with Prisma middleware for org isolation
4. In `database-migration` skill: replace `supabase db diff` with `prisma migrate dev`

### If you use tRPC instead of Server Actions
1. In `server-action` skill: replace with tRPC procedure patterns
2. Replace `revalidatePath()` with React Query invalidation
3. Keep the return type pattern (`{ success, data, error }`)

### If you use Jest instead of Vitest
1. Replace `vi.mock()` with `jest.mock()` in testing skill
2. Replace `vi.fn()` with `jest.fn()`
3. Keep all testing patterns — they're framework-agnostic

### If you don't use a monorepo
1. Replace `@your-org/*` imports with relative paths (`@/lib/*`)
2. Remove Turborepo references from CI patterns
3. Keep all other patterns as-is

## External Tools Integration

| Tool | How It's Used | Required? |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **GitHub** | PRs, CI, code review | Yes (for PR/CI commands) |
| **Linear** | Issue tracking, triage | No (remove triage + linear-ticket skills) |
| **Sentry** | Error tracking, tracing | No (remove observability skills) |
| **Slack** | Notifications | No |
| **Vercel** | Deployment | No (any hosting works) |

*Every tool is swappable except Claude Code itself — that's what runs the system.*
