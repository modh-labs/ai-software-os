# Quick Start: Ship Your First Content This Week

> 5-day plan to launch your Modh Fundamentals content strategy.

---

## Day 1 (Monday): LinkedIn Text Post

**Goal:** Establish your positioning with a single high-impact post.

### The Post (Copy & Paste)

```
I see this problem everywhere:

Projects take 3+ months. Scope creeps weekly. Teams lose momentum.

Here's the system I use:

Every project scoped to 1–3 weeks max. I use 3 complexity tiers:
• Quick Win (0–2 days) → Ship as-is
• Standard (3–5 days) → Single ticket
• Complex (6+ days) → Break into milestones

If it's >3 weeks, it's too big. Break it down.

Real results:
• 90% of projects ship in <3 weeks
• Scope creep drops 70%
• Team velocity 3x

This system works because most teams confuse "big vision" with "big first version."

Ship small. Learn fast. Iterate.

DM me if your projects routinely take months.

## Day 4 (Thursday): Plan Your First Reel

**Morning (30 minutes):**
- Write the script (60 seconds):

```
[0–10s] "I join a software company. Here's what I see everywhere:"

[10–20s] "Projects take months. Scope creeps weekly. Teams lose momentum."

[20–30s] "The problem? No scoping discipline."

[30–45s] "Here's my system: Every project <3 weeks.
Quick Win (0–2 days). Standard (3–5 days). Complex (6+ days → break it down)."

[45–55s] "Real results: 90% of projects ship in <3 weeks. Team velocity 3x."

[55–60s] "DM me if your projects routinely take months."
```

**Afternoon (1 hour):**
- Film it (iPhone, natural lighting, authentic delivery)
- Edit in CapCut or Instagram Reels editor (add text overlays)

**Tips:**
- Talk to camera (like you're explaining to a client)
- Don't overproduce (authenticity > polish)
- Use text overlays for key stats (90%, 3x, etc.)

## Day 5 (Friday): Post Reel + Weekly Recap

**Morning (5 minutes):**
- Post reel to Instagram + TikTok + LinkedIn (native video)

## Common Questions

### "What if I get negative comments?"

**Answer:** Direct communication is one of your values. Engage honestly:
- "What's worked better for you?" (learn from them)
- "Happy to discuss — DM me and we can dig into specifics."

### "What if nobody engages?"

**First week is slow.** Keep shipping. Engagement compounds.

**Tactics to boost:**
- Comment on 10 posts/day from your target audience (CTOs, VPs of Eng)
- Tag people in your posts ("Shoutout to @person for teaching me this")
- Cross-post to Reddit (r/startups, r/saas, r/engineering)

### "Do I need professional graphics?"

**No.** Authenticity > polish for the first 30 days.

Use Canva free templates. Or pay $20 on Fiverr for 4 carousels.

Your ideas matter more than your design skills.

### "What if someone steals my content?"

**Good.** It means it's valuable.

Your IP is **how you implement these systems**, not the ideas themselves. Anyone can read about two-way doors. You're the one who installs them.

## Time Investment

**Per week:**
- Monday post: 5 minutes
- Tuesday engagement: 30 minutes
- Wednesday carousel: 2 hours (first time), 30 minutes (after you have templates)
- Thursday reel planning: 1 hour
- Friday reel filming/posting: 1 hour

**Total: ~5 hours/week**

**ROI:** 1 consulting client at $10K–$20K/month pays for 100+ hours of content creation.

## Next Steps

1. **Right now:** Copy Monday's LinkedIn post, schedule it for tomorrow morning
2. **Tomorrow:** Engage with comments, plan your carousel
3. **Wednesday:** Post carousel to LinkedIn + Instagram
4. **Thursday:** Write + film your first reel
5. **Friday:** Post reel, review metrics

**Don't overthink it. Just ship.**

This is how you build your personal brand as a tech enabler and SaaS systems expert.
