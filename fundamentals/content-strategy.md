# Content Strategy: Modh Fundamentals

> How to repurpose these systems into social content that positions you as a tech enabler and SaaS scaling expert.

**Your Positioning:**

"I help software companies ship 10x faster by installing operational systems that actually work. Not theory. Battle-tested patterns from scaling real SaaS products."

**Your Audience:**

- CTOs and VPs of Engineering (your buyers)
- Founders scaling past 10 people (need your help)
- Senior engineers who want to learn systems (your influencers)

**Your Content Pillars:**

1. **Project Scoping** (how to ship in 1–3 week chunks)
2. **Decision Velocity** (10x faster decisions)
3. **Engineering Values** (culture that ships)
4. **Backlog Hygiene** (clean backlogs in 1–2 weeks)

## LinkedIn Strategy (Thought Leadership)

**Goal:** Position as **systems expert** who scales engineering teams.

### Post Format 1: Problem → System → Result

**Structure:**
```
I see this problem everywhere: [common dysfunction]

Here's the system I use to fix it: [your framework]

Real results: [metrics/outcomes]

[Call to action: DM me if you're dealing with this]
```

**Example Posts:**

**Post 1: Project Scoping**
```
I see this problem everywhere:

Projects take 3+ months. Scope creeps weekly. Teams lose momentum.

Here's the system I use:

Every project scoped to 1–3 weeks max. I use 3 complexity tiers:
• Quick Win (0–2 days) → Ship as-is
• Standard (3–5 days) → Single ticket
• Complex (6+ days) → Break into milestones

If it's >3 weeks, it's too big. Break it down.

Real results:
• 90% of projects ship in <3 weeks
• Scope creep drops 70%
• Team velocity 3x

This system works because most teams confuse "big vision" with "big first version."

Ship small. Learn fast. Iterate.

DM me if your projects routinely take months.
```

**Post 2: Decision Velocity**
```
Your team spends 3 days debating CSS class names.

Meanwhile, competitors are shipping features.

Here's what I do:

I teach teams the Two-Way Door framework (stolen from Amazon):

Two-way doors (reversible):
• Component structure, styling, copy
• Action: Ship immediately. No approval needed.

One-way doors (hard to reverse):
• Database schema, API contracts, billing
• Action: 24–48 hour discussion, then decide.

90% of decisions are two-way doors.

Stop treating them like one-way doors.

Real results:
• 90% of decisions made same-day
• One-way doors decided in 24–48 hours (vs weeks)
• Engineers ship 5x more (stop waiting for approval)

The unlock: Teaching teams which decisions actually matter.

DM me if your team has analysis paralysis.
```

**Post 3: Backlog Hygiene**
```
I join a company. I open their backlog. 500+ tickets.

Half are from 2 years ago. Nobody knows what's real.

Classic backlog bankruptcy.

Here's how I fix it in 1–2 weeks:

Week 1: The Big Cleanup
• Close tickets >3 months old (if not started)
• Close duplicates
• Close vague tickets ("improve performance")
• Add complexity labels to what's left

Result: 500 tickets → 50 actionable tickets

Week 2: Install Ongoing System
• Auto-close tickets after 3 months
• Triage new bugs within 72 hours
• No vague tickets allowed

Real results:
• Backlogs stay <50 tickets
• Teams know what's actually getting worked on
• Decision paralysis eliminated

The unlock: A backlog that reflects reality, not wishful thinking.

DM me if your backlog has 200+ tickets.
```

### LinkedIn Carousel Format (Visual Education)

**Goal:** Teach one framework per carousel. Easy to save, share, repurpose.

**Slide Structure (5–7 slides):**

1. **Hook:** "Your team ships too slow. Here's why."
2. **Problem:** "Most projects take months. Scope creeps weekly."
3. **Framework:** "I use 3 complexity tiers..." (visual diagram)
4. **Example:** "Quick Win: 0–2 days. Standard: 3–5 days. Complex: 6+ days."
5. **Anti-Pattern:** "Don't mix enabler work with feature work"
6. **Results:** "90% of projects ship in <3 weeks"
7. **CTA:** "DM me to install this system at your company"

**Carousel Ideas:**

| Carousel Title | Slides | Hook |
|----------------|--------|------|
| "How I Ship Projects in <3 Weeks" | Project scoping tiers | "Your projects take months. Mine take weeks." |
| "The Two-Way Door Framework" | Decision velocity | "Your team debates everything. Here's what I do." |
| "6 Values That Ship Faster" | Engineering values | "Most values are fluff. Mine translate to daily behavior." |
| "Clean Your Backlog in 1 Week" | Backlog hygiene | "500 tickets → 50 tickets in 1 week. Here's how." |

## Instagram Strategy (Personal Brand Building)

**Goal:** Position as **tech enabler** who understands software at a systems level.

### Post Format 1: Single-Image Graphic (Quote-Style)

**Visual:**
- Clean typography
- Your branding colors
- 1 key insight per post

**Examples:**

**Graphic 1:**
```
"Most teams optimize for perfect decisions.

I optimize for fast decisions.

Speed wins."

— Ibrahim Gardezi
Tech Enabler | SaaS Systems Expert
```

**Graphic 2:**
```
"If your project is >3 weeks,

it's not a project.

It's 3 projects pretending to be one."

— Ibrahim Gardezi
```

**Graphic 3:**
```
"90% of decisions are reversible.

Stop treating them like they're permanent."

— Ibrahim Gardezi
```

---

### Post Format 2: Process Breakdown (Carousel)

**Structure:** Show step-by-step how you solve a specific problem.

**Example: "How I Clean a 500-Ticket Backlog in 1 Week"**

**Slide 1:** "Your backlog: 500 tickets. Nobody knows what's real."

**Slide 2:** "My approach: Ruthless classification"

**Slide 3:** "Zombies (60%): Created >3 months ago → Close"

**Slide 4:** "Duplicates (15%): Same work → Close"

**Slide 5:** "Vague (15%): No clear scope → Close or rewrite"

**Slide 6:** "Actionable (10%): Keep these"

**Slide 7:** "Result: 500 → 50 tickets. Clean backlog in 1 week."

**Slide 8:** "DM me if you're dealing with backlog bankruptcy."

---

### Post Format 3: Before/After Results

**Visual:** Split screen showing before/after metrics.

**Example:**

**Left Side (Before):**
- Projects: 3+ months
- Backlog: 500 tickets
- Decisions: 3-day Slack threads

**Right Side (After):**
- Projects: <3 weeks (90%)
- Backlog: <50 tickets
- Decisions: 24–48 hours

**Caption:**
```
This is what happens when you install systems that actually work.

Not theory. Battle-tested at real SaaS companies.

I help CTOs and engineering leaders ship 10x faster by installing:
• Project scoping (1–3 week chunks)
• Decision velocity (two-way doors)
• Backlog hygiene (ruthless pruning)

DM me if you're scaling past 10 engineers and need help.
```

## Reels/TikTok Strategy (Viral Education)

**Goal:** Quick, punchy education that gets shared.

### Reel Format 1: "Here's What I See Everywhere" (60 seconds)

**Script:**

[0–10s] "I join a software company. Here's what I see everywhere:"

[10–20s] "Projects take months. Scope creeps weekly. Teams lose momentum."

[20–30s] "The problem? No scoping discipline."

[30–45s] "Here's my system: Every project <3 weeks. Quick Win (0–2 days). Standard (3–5 days). Complex (6+ days → break it down)."

[45–55s] "Real results: 90% of projects ship in <3 weeks. Team velocity 3x."

[55–60s] "DM me if your projects routinely take months."

**Visuals:**
- You talking to camera (authentic, not overproduced)
- Text overlays for key points
- B-roll of you working (coding, Linear board, whiteboarding)

---

### Reel Format 2: "Two-Way vs One-Way Doors" (45 seconds)

**Script:**

[0–10s] "Your team spends 3 days debating CSS class names."

[10–20s] "Here's the problem: You treat every decision like it's permanent."

[20–35s] "My framework: Two-way doors (reversible) → ship immediately. One-way doors (hard to reverse) → discuss 24–48 hours, then decide."

[35–45s] "90% of decisions are two-way doors. Stop waiting for approval."

**Visuals:**
- Split screen: Two-way (green, fast) vs One-way (red, slow)
- Examples scrolling (component structure = two-way, database schema = one-way)

---

### Reel Format 3: "Backlog in 60 Seconds" (60 seconds)

**Script:**

[0–10s] "Your backlog: 500 tickets. Half from 2 years ago."

[10–20s] "Here's how I fix it in 1 week:"

[20–30s] "Step 1: Close tickets >3 months old (that's 60–70%)"

[30–40s] "Step 2: Close duplicates and vague tickets (another 20%)"

[40–50s] "Step 3: Add complexity labels to what's left"

[50–60s] "Result: 500 → 50 actionable tickets. DM me if you need help."

**Visuals:**
- Screenshare of Linear/Jira backlog
- Numbers counting down (500 → 350 → 150 → 50)
- End screen: "DM for backlog cleanup"

5. **Newsletter** (Sunday - long-form deep dive)

**Effort:** 2 hours to create all 5 versions (batch content creation)

---

## Calls to Action (Every Post)

**Soft CTA (Top of Funnel):**
- "Save this if you're dealing with [problem]"
- "Follow for more systems that actually work"
- "Tag a CTO who needs to see this"

**Medium CTA (Middle of Funnel):**
- "DM me if you're dealing with [specific problem]"
